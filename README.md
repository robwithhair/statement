# Statement
Allows for the conversion of PDF credit card statements from Bank of Scotland, Halifax and MBNA to machine readable CSV files.

All of the above banks support only the last 6 months of statement downloading in a machine readable format such as CSV via their online banking.  I have made each aware of this issue over many years, and attempted to get statements in a machine readable format from them before putting my time into writing this utility.  I hope others find this useful.

Usage of this tool is free to all except banks, where a licence fee is negotiable on request.  Pull request welcome.

Statement requires the command line utility pdftotext to be installed.  It is built and installed using Haskell Stack.  See Haskell Stack documentation for installation steps.
